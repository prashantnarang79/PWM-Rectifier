# Matlab Simulation of a PWM-Rectifier

This repository contains a MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation of a PWM-controlled rectifier using a Power Factor Correction (PFC) Boost Converter.

## Project Objective

To simulate and analyze a Pulse Wisth Modulation (PWM) Rectifier. The aim is to:

- Eliminate harmonic currents caused by non-linear loads.
- Draw a nearly sinusoidal current from the AC source.
- Improve the power factor close to unity.
- Regulate the DC bus voltage effectively.

## Construction

The setup includes:
- **Diode Bridge Rectifier**: Converts the AC mains to an unregulated DC voltage.
- **Boost Converter**: Steps up and regulates the DC voltage.
- **PFC Controller**: Forces the input current to track a sinusoidal reference using a current control strategy (here, **hysteresis control**).

Together, this forms an **AC-DC rectifier with power factor correction**.

## How It Works

1. The diode bridge rectifies the AC input, producing a pulsating DC.
2. The boost converter steps up the DC voltage to the desired level.
3. A **PI voltage controller** compares the DC output with the reference and generates a current command.
4. A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** generates a reference sine wave.
5. A **hysteresis current controller** switches the power MOSFET to shape the inductor current.
6. The total input current becomes nearly sinusoidal and in phase with the voltage, reducing Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).

## System Overview

The simulated system includes:

- **Non-linear Load**: A full-bridge diode rectifier acting as the harmonic source.
- **PFC Boost Converter**: Connected in shunt to compensate for harmonic distortion.
- **Driver Circuit**: Developed using a **hysteresis current controller** for real-time current tracking.
- **Control Loop**: Includes a PI voltage controller and phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize with the supply voltage.

## Key Results

| Metric              | Without PFC | With PFC     |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) | 242%       | 13%          |
| Power Factor        | 0.38 lagging | 0.993 (near unity) |
| Source Current      | Highly distorted | Nearly sinusoidal |

- The supply current waveform becomes sinusoidal after compensation.
- FFT analysis confirms substantial reduction in lower-order harmonics.
- Power factor improvement is significant and aligns with IEEE 519 standards.

## Key Learnings

- **Integration of PFC and Active Filtering**: A single PFC boost converter can both regulate voltage and compensate for harmonics.
- **Effective Harmonic Cancellation**: Harmonic currents generated by the non-linear load can be nearly eliminated at the source itself.
- **Closed-Loop Control**: A PI controller combined with hysteresis current control enables dynamic compensation with fast response.
- **Simplified Topology**: The entire PFC + filtering system can be implemented with just one converter, reducing cost and complexity.
- **Power Quality Improvement**: THD reduced from 242% to 13%, and power factor improved from 0.38 to 0.993.
- **Simulation-Driven Design**: MATLAB/Simulink provides an ideal platform to model, analyze, and optimize power electronics circuits before hardware implementation.
